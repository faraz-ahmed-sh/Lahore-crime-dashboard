## Through this project, I have created an interactive Dashboard to analyze the Crime Rate of Lahore for the year 2014. 

The crime rate can be analyzed by the hour of the day, date of the occurrence of the crime, and the type of crime for each of the 10 union towns (Ravi, Shalamar, Wagha, Aziz Bhatti, Data Gunj Baksh, Gulberg, Samanabad, Iqbal, Nishtar and Cantonment) of the city.

**Tools used in this project:**

- D3.js and other .js libraries (crossfilter.js, bootstrap.js etc.)
- HTML/CSS
- R
